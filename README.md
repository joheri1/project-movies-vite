# Movie Site Project

This app displays the most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDB). Data is fetched from the TMDB API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to dynamically show popular movies and their details. The site is built with React, using React components to structure the app, and React Router to navigate between different pages.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to handle its dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
Before deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```
